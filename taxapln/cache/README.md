# Model cache

This folder contains the model weights obtained from training on the datasets of the `curatedMetagenomicData` package, as well as classifiers predictions.

Due to the large size of the files, we deposit them on [Zenodo](), where you can download them using the following command:
```bash
wget https://zenodo.org/record/10000000/files/cache.zip
```
Then, unzip the file in the `taxapln` folder and merge it with the existing `cache` folder:
```bash
unzip cache.zip
```
